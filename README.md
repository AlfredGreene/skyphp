This project aims to provide a PHP library to allow the extraction of television programme data from the Sky TV platform and to allow remote recording (not started yet).

## What's what?

The main library code is in the "skyphp.php" file at the top of the repository. Some test files are in the test directory.

```
  cd test
  ./getlistings.php
  
```
